MIPS Syntax file.

Based on [Alex Brick's syntax file](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2045 "mips.vim : Your standard MIPS syntax highlighting ").

I added a few instructions, and tried and grouped them following this [Instruction Set](http://www.weblearn.hs-bremen.de/risse/RST/docs/MIPS/mips-isa.pdf) document. I may edit this file again in the future, as the mips-opc.c file from the binutils source might be of some use.
